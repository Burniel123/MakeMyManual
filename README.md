# MakeMyManual - KTANE Manual Creation Software
---
### What is MakeMyManual?
**MakeMyManual** is an application under development to be used alongside the game *Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes* and its associated mods.

Each module both in the base game and community-made mods requires its own manual page(s). Many players choose to download and print these documents to obtain physical copies, but many others choose to play the role of expert using an on-screen manual. For this, there are options available, including the game's in-built option to export a combined manual for all the modules downloaded to the defuser's machine, or alternatively the fantastic community-led online [repository of manual pages](https://ktane.timwi.de).

Both of the above options require experts to repeatedly search either their document or the manual repository for the manual page they require during the course of a bomb. When a lot of mods are involved and tight time limits are being used, this causes a noticeable loss of productivity for the experts. MakeMyManual eliminates this issue by producing a custom manual consisting of the exact modules specified by the user, indexed such that any module can be accessed with a single click. This allows experts to be as efficient as if they had a printed manual in a sorted physical binder.

### What does it do?
Features of the software, in its current state, include:
* **A manual for this specific mission** - produce a .pdf manual containing exactly the manual pages you need, as selected using a simple graphical display, and no more.
* **On the subject of sorting** - export a manual in alphabetical order for simple navigation.
* **I need you on this module, now!** - exported manuals are conveniently indexed with bookmarks, allowing an expert to jump between any two modules in the manual instantly.
* **Keep things organised and nobody explodes** - optionally, separate sections for vanilla and/or needy modules can be pinned to the end of the list to keep them from cluttering the list of solvable, modded modules.

### What does it not do?
To avoid any suspicion that this software violates the rules of the game or attempts to replace existing solutions, the software is not (and probably never will be) capable of the following:
* Adapt existing manual pages in any way - doing so would be heavily against common opinion on how the game should be played, and would be insulting to members of the community who have worked hard on the manual pages.
* Produce a profile.json file based on your selected modules - tools to do this already exist: see [here](https://ktane.timwi.de/More/Profile%20Editor.html). A sensible order would be to first create a profile using an existing tool and then to use this software to create a manual based upon it.
* Act as a manual page repository in its own right - this software relies on the community repository, which many people work diligently on, and thus it shall remain impossible to use this application to quickly view a single manual page "on-the-fly".

### What will it do in the future?
Ideas currently being considered for the future include:
* Ability to sort the manual by properties other than module name.
* Ability to create more sophisticated indexing structures, including multi-tiered bookmarks based on various criteria for even faster navigation.

### Where can I get it?
MakeMyManual is not currently available publicly, but volunteer beta testers are likely to be requested shortly.
